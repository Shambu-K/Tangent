# Tangent 
Tangent is a statically typed, object-oriented programming language
intended for creating vector graphics. It takes design cues from python's
Matplotlib and C++'s functionality. Using built-in classes on an SVG, Tangent
may be used to plot a variety of complicated figures, such as bezier curves
and polygons. Tangent offers the capability to carry out standard
programming activities as well as the simplicity of charting and viewing
two-dimensional data. Despite Tangent being an object oriented language,
we are trying to make it simple, readable, and portable.

Tangent is created the Compilers II project. Contributors :
